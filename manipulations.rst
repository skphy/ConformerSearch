Molecular Modeling Tools for Tinker

## Read/write chemical structure files

Supported formats: xyz, txyz

* Compute trajectories RMSDs
* Analyze structures
  * Distance
  * Angle
  * Torsion
  * Pseudo-rotation angle
  * Distance to line
  * Distance to plane
  * Angle between two planes

## Manipulate chemical structures

* Automatically fragment structures
* Find principle axes of the interface between two fragments
* Translate and/or rotate one fragment relative to the other fragment
* Delete or add trajectories or atoms
